This is effectively the quantile or ppf of a statistical distribution. For convenience, if a vector of Distribution is provided (as a set of priors), a transformation function will automatically be constructed using Distributions.quantile.\n\nNote: loglike is the only function used for likelihood calculations. This means if you want your priors to be used for the likelihood calculations they must be manually included in the loglike function.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"api/#NestedSamplers.Nested","page":"API/Reference","title":"NestedSamplers.Nested","text":"Nested(ndims, nactive;\n    bounds=Bounds.MultiEllipsoid,\n    proposal=:auto,\n    enlarge=1.25,\n    update_interval=default_update_interval(proposal, ndims),\n    min_ncall=2nactive,\n    min_eff=0.10)\n\nStatic nested sampler with nactive active points and ndims parameters.\n\nndims is equivalent to the number of parameters to fit, which defines the dimensionality of the prior volume used in evidence sampling. nactive is the number of live or active points in the prior volume. This is a static sampler, so the number of live points will be constant for all of the sampling.\n\nBounds and Proposals\n\nbounds declares the Type of Bounds.AbstractBoundingSpace to use in the prior volume.
